    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p>Hey!</p>
    <p>My name is Stacey. I'm originally a Wiganer now living in Bolton, and I'm looking for a career change. If you've arrived here, chances are that either I've applied for a job you're advertising, or you've found me through LinkedIn.</p>
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <ul class="ints">
        <li>History - the dark social kind.</li>
        <li>Football - Latics fan <s>for my sins!</s></li>
        <li>Ballooning - I started an event decor business which you can see on my <a href="http://www.instagram.com/phballoonco">Instagram</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <p>Most recently, my experience is entirely within the construction industry. I worked my way from admin assistant at a small window company to installation manager at a large uPVC commercial manufacturer and installer for new build homes.</p>
        <p>I'm currently on a career break. I'm caring for a relative who is suffering from poor health and using my free time to learn as much as I can to prepare me for a junior role using the coding skills I'm gathering.</p>
